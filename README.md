# Measles Rubella Immunization Activities

## Overview
This project utilizes advanced data visualization techniques in Tableau to analyze global immunization data, specifically focusing on measles and rubella vaccination efforts from 2000 to 2024. The goal was to uncover significant trends and provide actionable insights for public health stakeholders to enhance vaccination strategies.

## Objectives
1. Analyze immunization coverage to identify trends and disparities across different regions and time periods.
2. Visualize data effectively to help stakeholders understand complex datasets and facilitate strategic planning.
3. Support decision-making by providing a suite of interactive tools for exploring immunization data.

## Tools Used
1. **Tableau Desktop:** Used for all data visualization tasks.
2. **Microsoft Excel:** Used for data preprocessing and cleaning.

## Data
The dataset includes records of immunization activities across multiple countries, with details on target and reached populations, intervention types, and coverage percentages. Key attributes include:

1. Year and date of activity
2. WHO region and country
3. Type of immunization activity
4. Target versus reached population
5. Percentage coverage

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing -** Cleaned and structured raw data using Excel, ensuring accurate representation in Tableau.
2. **Visualization Design -** Developed various visual representations such as line graphs, heat maps, and bubble charts to illustrate different aspects of the data.
3. **Interactive Dashboard Creation -** Created comprehensive Tableau dashboards that allow users to filter and interact with the data dynamically.

## Visualizations
1. **Trend Analysis:** Line graphs to track changes in immunization coverage over time.
2. **Geographic Distribution:** Heat maps and bubble charts to show coverage by region.
3. **Resource Allocation:** Tree maps to depict funding or vaccine distribution across activities.
4. **Activity Tracking:** Gantt charts to visualize the duration and overlap of immunization campaigns.

## Results
1. Highlighted regions with suboptimal coverage, guiding targeted interventions.
2. Identified trends indicating the effectiveness of different types of immunization activities.
3. Enabled data-driven decision-making through interactive dashboards, enhancing the planning and execution of future campaigns.

## How to use the dashboard
1. **Filter Options:** Users can select specific years, regions, or types of interventions to narrow down the data.
2. **Interactive Elements:** Click on any graph element to drill down into detailed views or related data.
